Dear Mrs XYZ,
I am submitting my application for consideration for the internship program at Defence Research and Development Organisation(DRDO) 
under the Scientific Analysis Group(SAG). 

I am in the pre-final year of Engineering and have undergone training in Wireless Networks and Security along with which I have been 
 participating in various jeopardy style capture the flag (CTF) computer security competetions along with a team. I have created a 
 beginner friendly graphical user interface version of HashCat password recovery tool.I have also participated in some hackathons 
 relating to IOT and undergone a few mini projects as well.

Through these experiences, along with my coursework in Computer Science Engineering, I am confident that I would be able to successfully 
navigate the challenges of this internship and  will be a worthy asset to your team.I look forward to hearing from you.

With regards,

Anmol Bose
